# Majority Custom Plugins

## Overview

We have put together a Custom Plugin with a simple structure that can be executed using only HTML and JavaScript.

Since it is not necessary to use a framework such as Node.js, it is a sample that can be deployed on a wide variety of servers, so we hope that you will find it useful.

## Getting Started with Examples

Here are some examples of plugins you can use as a reference for developing your own:

| Plugin Name           | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Majority](./public/) | This is a tool to efficiently perform majority voting among participants. |

To use these plugins, simply clone the repository, navigate to the relevant directory, and open the HTML file in your web browser. You can then examine the code to see how the plugin works and make any necessary adjustments to tailor it to your specific requirements.
